# ReFrame
A simple reframing calculator made in C++ for the Terminal. It's designed to find either relative focal length or distance, to maintain same framing on subject. Coded in Xubuntu 22.04.3 LTS.
## Inputs
The code takes as input, in order, these four values: current focal length, current distance from subject, target static value, and type of operation (either find focal length or distance, with a char input 'd' or 'f', either upper or lower cased)
## Running the program
Just open the run.sh file, and it will execute the program in a Terminal.
